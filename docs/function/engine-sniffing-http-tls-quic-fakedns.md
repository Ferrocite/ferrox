# Engine sniffing

An inbound's `sniffing` block reads the first bytes of a flow before routing and before the outbound dials, so a destination that arrived as an address can become the `Host` or SNI the client itself named. The engine registers one parsed config per listener, inspects TCP through a bounded `peek` and UDP per datagram, and hands the router both a `protocol` and a `domain`. The same result can override the dial target, replace a FakeDNS address with its domain, or leave the original destination in place while still selecting a `protocol` rule.

The carried protocols are xray's five: HTTP/1 (`GET`, `POST`, `HEAD`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `OPTIONS`, `CONNECT`, with the first `Host` head, IPv6 brackets and an optional port), TLS 1.2/1.3 ClientHello SNI, QUIC Initial SNI for v1, v2 and draft-29, BitTorrent/µTP handshakes, and FakeDNS metadata. `destOverride` accepts `http`, `tls`/`https`/`ssl`, `quic`, `bittorrent`, and `fakedns`/`fakedns+others`; matching is prefix-based, so the `http1`/`http2`/`http3` protocol names a rule may read still match an `http` override. `domainsExcluded` and `ipsExcluded` use the router's own domain and IP matchers, and a blocked override keeps the original address. `metadataOnly` still resolves FakeDNS but reads no payload; `routeOnly` keeps the dial address unless the result is a FakeDNS domain. A loopback outbound applies its own block before the TCP re-inject, so the named inbound receives the sniffed name; its datagram half keeps the named dial's lane, as the reference's loopback handler is TCP-only.

A config that arrives through the protobuf bridge gets the same block: `enabled`, `destOverride`, `metadataOnly` and `routeOnly` decode into the JSON the engine parses.

Syscalls: one TCP probe issues `peek` calls on the client until the HTTP head or TLS ClientHello is whole, the 32 KiB buffer fills, or 200 ms pass; UDP adds no syscall beyond the datagram already read. Copies: the probe fills one 32 KiB buffer per TCP flow, and the detected domain is one `String`; neither has a pointer-identity test that separates it from the buffer it came from, so no copy row is claimed. The worst case the TCP tests do not reach is a header split across `peek` boundaries: the loop re-peeks with the same buffer until the 200 ms deadline, so a slow client delays the dial rather than truncating the name; a full 32 KiB buffer with no match falls through to the original destination.

## Ops

```bash
./scripts/count-ops.sh report \
  sniff::tests::reads_http_host_and_tls_sni 'ferrox_app::sniff::Sniffing::inspect'
```

`UNBLESSED`, as above.

## Time

**Not measured yet.** Durations in this repository come from CI runners (`bench.yml`, `parity.yml`); no cell isolates a sniffer, and no CI artefact has been read. A local run behind a VPN would measure a tunnel either way.

## What we removed

- **A buffer per protocol.** One 32 KiB `peek` buffer feeds HTTP, TLS and BitTorrent in order, and the parse functions borrow it; QUIC and µTP read the datagram the UDP lane already holds.
- **A second routing lookup for a sniffed name.** The probe returns `protocol` and `domain` together, the router reads both from one `Flow`, and the override is applied to the same plan that selected the outbound.
- **A byte-at-a-time line walk.** The HTTP sniffer found its request line's end, each following line's end and each field-name colon with `iter().position` over the peeked head; all three are now `ferrox_core::foxy::octet_in`, the eight-octet scan the http front's own head walk uses, and the rule that the name ends at the first colon and the line at the first `\n` is unchanged — `reads_http_host_and_tls_sni` and `parses_the_fields_xray_names` hold the fields the walk yields, and `an_attrs_rule_reads_the_head_the_sniffer_read` (in the app's proxy tests) holds that the attributes derived from it still route a sniffed flow.
- **A config rebuild for loopback.** A loopback outbound reuses its parsed `Sniffing` `Arc` on the re-inject; the named inbound's dial is unchanged.

What was **not** removed: the 200 ms wait on a TCP flow that sends nothing recognizable, and the 32 KiB probe buffer for every enabled TCP flow even when the first bytes do not parse. A plain HTTP forward sets `http/1.1` from its own request head and runs no second sniff over the forwarded origin-form bytes, so its `protocol` selector sees the forward without a content-domain override. The loopback outbound's own sniffing is carried, but the named inbound's second routing pass remains row 27 rather than an engine claim.
